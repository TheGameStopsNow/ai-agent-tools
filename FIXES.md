# StoryForge Project - Bug Fixes

## TypeScript Type Definitions for NextAuth Session
The primary issue fixed was with the TypeScript type definitions for NextAuth session objects. The session user object was missing the `id` property in the type definition, causing TypeScript errors when accessing `session.user.id`.

### Solution:
Added proper type declarations for NextAuth in `src/types/next-auth.d.ts`:

```typescript
import NextAuth from "next-auth";

declare module "next-auth" {
  interface Session {
    user: {
      id: string;
      name?: string | null;
      email?: string | null;
      image?: string | null;
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures TypeScript correctly recognizes the `id` property on the session user object throughout the application.

## Other Notes

- The proper project directory structure was maintained
- All UI components and API routes are properly set up
- Authentication with Google OAuth is correctly configured
- The Prisma schema includes the necessary models for the application

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Ensure that TypeScript compiles without errors
3. Test the authentication flow to confirm it works properly
4. Test story creation and management functionality

## Remaining Tasks

- Add proper Google OAuth credentials in .env.local
- Set up a PostgreSQL database for production
- Implement proper error handling for API routes
- Add unit and integration tests
