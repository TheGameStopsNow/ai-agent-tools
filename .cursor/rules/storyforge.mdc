### AI Agent Rules:

1. **Progress and Bug Tracking**:
   - Regularly update the document [03_PROGRESS_REPORT.md](mdc:StoryForge/docs/03_PROGRESS_REPORT.md) to track progress and log any bugs.

2. **Project Information**:
    - Always keep [04_PROJECT_RULES.md](mdc:StoryForge/04_PROJECT_RULES.md) updated and refer to it regularly to avoid duplicating functionality and to work efficiently.

3. **UI Components**:
   - Always use **MUI** elements where applicable for consistency and styling.
   - Use **MUI icons** instead of emojis.
   - Ensure styling aligns with the **MUI theme**.

4. **Layout and Structure**:
   - Use **layouts**, **grids**, and **containers** to build pages and organize content properly.

5. **Testing**:
   - Always write tests when appropriate to ensure code reliability.

6. **Consistency**:
   - Follow established patterns from existing files. If uncertain, refer to them to maintain consistency.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Check the console for any errors and fix them before requesting any review.

8. **Documentation**:
   - When making significant changes to core functionality, update the relevant documentation and the README file.

9. **Animations**:
   - Prefer using **Framer Motion** for animations.
   - Use subtle, professional animations and transitions that follow motion design principles. Avoid "pop" animations; instead, elements should animate intelligently in and out to reflect their purpose.

10. **Target Audience**:
    - Design with retail traders in mind, partich little knowledge of the stock market. Aim for simplicity, ease of understanding, and aesthetic appeal.

11. **New Features**:
    - If a new feature or rule is introduced, create a "NEW RULES TO FOLLOW:" section at the top of the progress doc so I can add it to this list.

12. **Screenshots**:
    - You are allowed to use AI-agent tools to take screenshots without needing permission or checking with me first.

13. **Build in correct folder** 
    - Check your directory before beginning to work becasue you often build in the wrong place and miss entire project files already completed. No re-inventing the wheel.
